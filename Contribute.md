# How to Contribute

I expect there will be two ways to contribute; <br> 
Via the GitHub repository or; emailing the files to me.


## Recipe Template
Copy the following temple into notepad or your text editor of choice and save as a markdown file (*.md)

Edit the title and tags properties to suit. You can see a list of tags in existing use in the sidebar.<br>
If this recipe is modified from another recipe or requires links to external notes please add any links at the bottom of the file.

Until I change my linking set-up, **the title and filename need to be the same.**
