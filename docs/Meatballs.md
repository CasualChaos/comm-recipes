## Description  
It's meatballs. Idk what to say. Make a bunch and keep in the fridge for subs with some [Simple Pasta Sauce](./Simple%20Pasta%20Sauce.md). Have it with spaghetti.   
## Ingredients  
   
- 1kg beef, 80/20 preferred   
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs  
- 1/2 cup milk, whole preferred   
- 2 eggs  
- 1 yellow onion grated, plus any juices  
- 1 clove garlic grated/minced  
- 2 tsps dried oregano (or mixed herbs)  
- 1 tsp salt  
- 1/2 tsp black pepper  
  
  
## Instructions   
1. Preheat your oven to 190C  
2. In a large bowl, mix everything except beef until everything is uniformly wet.  
3. Add beef mince and mix until everything is just combined. Try not to overwork it. Mixing with your hands is best, but you can use a spoon if you don't like handling raw meat.  
4. Form meatballs with your hands and place onto a baking tray. If using lean beef, spray tray with cooking oil first. A large soup spoon/ice cream scoop works well for scooping.  
5. Bake the meatballs in the centre of the oven for 30 minutes.  
6. Serve as you like.
