## Description  
Red beans are the best.   
You don't have to add butter, but it makes the texture smoother.   
If you have rock sugar, use that instead. But any combo of sugar is good.   
Store in the fridge for up to a week or you can freeze.  
## Ingredients  
   
- 200 g red beans (adzuki beans) - about 1 cup  
- 500 ml water  
- 2 tablespoon white sugar  
- 2 tablespoon dark brown sugar  
- 80 g butter, sub with 40g coconut oil for vegan ver  
## Instructions   
1. Soak the beans overnight to soften. Or cook for an extra 30-60min.   
2. Put the beans into a pot with water. Bring to a boil then leave to simmer for 1 to 1.5 hours until they become soft and easy to crush. If you didn't pre-soak your beans, cook for an extra hour or so.   
>Check the water level occasionally. Make sure the beans are covered, top up if necessary.   
3. Drain beans and return to pot. Add sugar and butter and mash the beans.  
4. If you feel that your paste is a bit too runny you can put it back on the heat and boil off some moisture. Stir constantly to avoid burning. Be aware that your paste will be firmer when cold.
