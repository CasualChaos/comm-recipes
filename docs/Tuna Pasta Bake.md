## Description  
## Ingredients  
   
- 1 tbsp olive oil  
- 2 garlic cloves , minced  
- 1 small onion , finely diced  
- 800g diced tomato  
- 3/4 cup water, or stock  
- 1 tbsp Italian mixed herbs  
- 1 tsp salt  
- 1/2 tsp black pepper  
- 425g can chunk tuna (preferably in oil), drained  
- 200g spiral pasta  
- 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese  
## Instructions   
  
1. Preheat oven to 180C.  
2. Start the sauce. Heat a pan over medium high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 3 minutes until golden.  
3. Add tomato, water, herbs, salt and pepper. Stir, bring to simmer, lower heat to medium and simmer energetically for 5 minutes (stir every now and then) until it thickens. Adjust salt to taste.  
4. Leave simmering for up to 20min. Especially if using grated carrots  
5. Cook pasta per packet directions, minus 2-3 minutes. Drain, rinse under tap water to stop it sticking together, add to baking dish.  
6. Turn the stove off, pour on top of pasta. Stir lightly.   
7.  Add tuna and GENTLY stir it in – don’t break up the tuna so it disintegrates into mush. Leave some chunks on the surface.  
8. Top with cheese then bake for 20 minutes until golden.   
9. Stand for 3 minutes then serve!
