## Description  
Simple pizza dough. Start it like 30 -60min before you want to make your pizza.  
Add whatever toppings you'd like.   
Also good for [Filled Pretzel Rolls](./Filled%20Pretzel%20Rolls.html).  
  
#### Notes  
If your yeast has been in the fridge let it sit out for at least half an hour to come to room temp.  
If it's too cold for your dough to rise, create a warming drawer by preheating your oven to 50$^o$ C or as low as possible before turning off. Cover your dough and leave in the oven to rise.  
  
## Ingredients  
   
- 375ml warm water  
- pinch of sugar  
- 2tsp dried yeast (or one of those 7g sachets)  
- 600g plain flour  
- 1tsp salt  
- 60ml (1/4cup) oil (probably olive)  
- extra plain flour for kneading, dusting, etc  
  
## Instructions   
1. Mix water, sugar and yeast together and aside until foamy, (about 5min).  
2. Mix your flour and salt together in a large bowl.  
3. Add your yeast mixture and oil to the flour.   
4. Carefully mix.   
	1. You can use a butter knife to slice until it starts coming together  
	2. Or you can be lazy and carefully use your hands to mix and bring together. Be careful not to overwork your dough this way.  
5. Lightly flour the bench and turn your dough onto it. Knead for up to 10min. You'll know your dough is ready when you gently push your finger tip in and it bounces back quickly.  
6. Fold the dough into itself until it's smooth and place into an oiled, clean bowl.   
	1. Or don't. It'll be fine. Just bring your dough together and chuck it back into the same bowl to save dishes.  
7. Cover with plastic wrap or a tea towel and leave somewhere warm to rise for 30min-an hour. Dough should double in size.  
	1. In front of a window or the oven trip mentioned above.  
8. Divide into 3-4 pieces and roll out. Add your toppings, put in the oven at 200$^o$C for about 15min. Keep an eye on it, ovens vary.
