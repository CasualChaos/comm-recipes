Some cool places that I like for recipes or cooking tips.

## Ethan Chlebowski
This guy has YouTube channel and a cooking website. Both are great.  
Lots of good ideas. Clear instructions. He also does videos where tries different ingredients at different price points.

## Nutrition By Kylie
She's a dietitian on YouTube. Got some great healthy and simple recipes. 
I feel like this woman has inspired a bunch of my kitchen purchases. 10/10  

[Rice Cooker Salmon](https://youtube.com/shorts/DZyEwuGHpHQ?si=wOgdaLKcEQVbnhKb) - So easy and good.  
[Quick Salad](https://youtube.com/shorts/O_7ZvwhzqGg?si=kIoP-TfLUvG8Ed4I) - Genuinely bought that salad box and love it.  
[Rice Paper Omlette](https://youtube.com/shorts/WHtf5FhFfAY?si=68iIlg6P4mxZ67b6)  
[Ramen Jars](https://youtube.com/shorts/AkrXs5WxjT0?si=AAQgBHlLC0ESyPfp) - Also easy, make sure the jars you use can survive the hot water. Do not go directly from fridge to boiling water. The shock might shatter your jars.  
[Feta Eggs](https://youtube.com/shorts/kMuDa7Vg0O4?si=TJU83dMurawo-sA9) - Have not tried. But I will.  

## Preppy Kitchen

I've baked a bunch of cookies and some of the cakes from this site. Always gone well.  
He also has a YouTube channel which is helpful for visual comparisons of dough consistency.
