### Description   
Quick, versatile fish. Serve with anything. Rice, potatoes and salad, steamed veggies.  
>Notes: The fish cooks so fast. Like 5 minutes.   
  
### Ingredients    
   
- 2 firm white fish fillets,   
>about 6 inches long, 2cm thickness throughout (cod, halibut, or mahi mahi are great )  
- 3 tbsp melted butter  
- Juice and zest from 1 medium lemon  
- ½ tsp salt  
- 1 tsp paprika  
- 1 tsp garlic powder  
- 1 tsp onion powder  
- ¼ tsp black pepper  
- 3 tbsp olive oil  
- freshly chopped basil or parsley leaves, for garnish  
## Instructions   
1. Use paper towels to pat excess moisture from fish fillets. This helps the fish brown. Set aside.  
2. In a bowl, combine melted butter, lemon juice and zest, and 1/2 tsp kosher salt. Add salt to taste.   
3. In a separate bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 tsp kosher salt, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. Evenly press spice mixture onto all sides of fish fillets.  
4. In a large pan over medium high heat, heat up the olive oil until hot. Once your oil is sizzling,  cook fish fillets in pan ,avoid overcrowding. Cook each side until fish becomes opaque and is browned, about 2-3 minutes per side; drizzle some of the lemon butter sauce as you cook, save some for serving. Try not to over cook, as fish gets tough.  
5. Serve fish with with remaining lemon butter sauce, basil or parsley, and lemon wedges if you're feeling fancy.
