### Description   
Quick, versatile fish. Serve with anything. Rice, potatoes and salad, steamed veggies.   
  
### Ingredients    
   
- 2 firm white fish fillets,   
>about 6 inches long, 2cm thickness throughout (cod, halibut, or mahi mahi are great )  
- 3 tbsp melted butter  
- Juice and zest from 1 medium lemon  
- ½ tsp salt  
- 1 tsp paprika  
- 1 tsp garlic powder  
- 1 tsp onion powder  
- ¼ tsp black pepper  
- 3 tbsp olive oil  
- freshly chopped basil or parsley leaves, for garnish  
## Instructions   
1. Use paper towels to pat excess moisture from fish fillets. This step is crucial for fish to brown nicely in pan – otherwise, it will steam instead of brown. Set aside.  
2. In a bowl, combine melted butter, lemon juice and zest, and 1/2 tsp kosher salt. Add more salt to taste.   
3. In a separate bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 tsp kosher salt, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. Evenly press spice mixture onto all sides of fish fillets.  
4. In a large pan over medium high heat, heat up the olive oil until hot. Once your oil is sizzling,  Cook 2 fish fillets at a time to avoid overcrowding (allows for even browning). Cook each side until fish becomes opaque and is browned, about 2-3 minutes per side; lightly drizzle some of the lemon butter sauce as you cook, reserving the rest for serving. Take care not to over-cook, as that will result in a tougher texture.   
5. Serve fish with with remaining lemon butter sauce, basil or parsley, and lemon wedges.
