## Ingredients  
   
Use [Pizza Dough](./Pizza%20Dough.html) as dough  
#### Filling Options  
**Breakfast rolls**  
- 2 cups Shredded Cheddar Cheese  
- 1 cup Diced Cooked Ham  
- 6 Eggs, scrambled  
  
**Pizza Rolls**  
- Tomato Paste

### Baking Soda Bath  
- 1/2 cup Warm Water  
- 2 tablespoons Baking Soda  
- Coarse Sea Salt, or kosher salt, for sprinkling  
- 2 tablespoons Unsalted Butter, melted, for brushing after baking  
## Instructions   
  
1. Make the pizza dough, while the dough is rising, prep your fillings, eg. Scramble eggs, cook ham/mushroom, etc.   
3. Preheat the oven to 220°C. Prep 2 baking trays. Optionally, in a large bowl mix premix filling together.   
4. Roll dough into a log and break into 8-10 equal balls.   
5. For each ball:   
	1. Roll out to a rectangle (eyeball dough to abt 3-4mm thick?)  
	2. Spread filling into the centre of each rectangle, leaving an inch or so on each long edge for closing.   
	3. Cut the long sides into 1-inch diagonal strips, and fold these strips over top of the filling, alternating sides to form a braid. Pinch the ends to seal the dough.  
6. In a bowl or mug, whisk together the warm water and the baking soda. Brush each roll with the baking . Sprinkle with coarse or kosher salt.   
7. Bake the rolls for 12-15 minutes or until the rolls are golden brown. When they come out of the oven, brush with the melted butter.
