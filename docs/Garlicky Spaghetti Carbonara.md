## Description  
It's garlic and pasta, what more do you want?   
Quick and easy dinner, usually with leftovers for lunch.   
  
## Ingredients  
   
- 8 rashers of bacon  
- 4 Eggs  
- 4 cloves garlic, minced  
- 50 ml cream  
- 85g Parmesan, grated  
- 250g Spaghetti, approx  
- Parsley, shaved/diced whatever  
- Salt (1tsp) and pepper (1/2 tsp)  
  
## Instructions   
1. Put some water on to boil, season with salt. Add pasta when appropriate.   
2. Dice your bacon and fry in hot pan until crispy (5ish minutes). Transfer to plate lined with paper towel. Reserve some bacon fat if able.   
3. Whisk eggs and cream together. Add finely grated Parmesan, salt and pepper.   
4. Reserve a little pasta water and drain pasta when done.   
5. Add bacon fat or a little oil to empty pasta pot. Return to low heat and add minced garlic. Stir until fragrant (1-2 minutes).  
6. Add bacon and pasta back to pot. Turn heat to very low or remove completely. Add the egg mixture to pasta, stirring frequently. Stir just until the egg mixture begins to thicken, 3-4 minutes.  
7. If the sauce seems dry, add some of the reserved pasta water 1 tbsp at a time, until rich and creamy.  
8.  Add parsley to pot, reserving a small amount for garnish. Mix.   
9. Divide pasta between bowls and garnish with remaining parsley.
