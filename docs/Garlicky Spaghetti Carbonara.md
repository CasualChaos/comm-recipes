## Description  
It's garlic and pasta, what more do you want?   
Quick and easy dinner, usually with leftovers for lunch.   
  
## Ingredients  
   
- 8 rashers of bacon (diced), or enough diced mushrooms to bring joy  
- 4 Eggs  
- 4 cloves garlic, minced  
- 50 ml cream  
- 85g Parmesan, grated  
- 250g Spaghetti, approx  
- Parsley, shaved/diced whatever  
- Salt (1tsp) and pepper (1/2 tsp)  
  
## Instructions   
1. Put some water on to boil, season with salt. Add pasta when appropriate.   
2. Fry bacon in hot pan until crispy (5ish minutes). Transfer to plate lined with paper towel to soak fat. Reserve some bacon fat if able.   
3. Whisk eggs and cream together. Add finely grated parmesan, salt and pepper.   
4. Reserve a little pasta water in a mug and drain pasta when cooked.   
5. Add bacon fat or a little oil to empty pasta pot. Return to low heat and add minced garlic. Stir until fragrant (1-2 minutes). Do all this while pasta and pot are still hot/warm. 
6. Add bacon and pasta back to pot. Turn heat to very low or remove completely. Add the egg mixture to pasta, stirring frequently. Stir just until the egg mixture begins to thicken, 3-4 minutes.  
7. If the sauce seems dry, add some of the pasta water 1 tbsp at a time, until creamy.  
8. Add parsley to pot, leaving a bit to garnish. Mix.   
9. Divide pasta between bowls, garnish with remaining parsley.
