## Description  
Easy choc chip cookies.  
I like swapping 1/4 cup of choc chips for chopped walnuts   
  
No need to flatten out the dough balls they will melt and flatten in the oven.   
When softening the butter, add the bare minimum heat. The warmer your dough the flatter the cookies will become in the oven, trust me they can get too flat.  
  
## Ingredients  
   
- 125g butter, softened  
- ½ cup brown sugar  
- ⅓ cup caster sugar  
- 1 egg  
- 1 teaspoon vanilla  
- 1½ cups self raising flour  
- 3/4 cup choc chips or other mix-ins  
  
## Instructions  
  
1. Cream together butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Whisk in egg and vanilla. Stir in flour then fold through chocolate chips or other mix-ins.  
  
2. Roll a heaped teaspoon full of dough into a ball and place on greased baking trays. Bake at 160°C for 10-15 minutes or until edges are golden. Let sit for a few minutes and then cool on a wire rack.
