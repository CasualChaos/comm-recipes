Some of the vegan egg replacement options I've tried and liked. I know you can buy an egg replacer powder, I've never tried it and these are pretty easy.  
    
  
I mostly use these in baking, I haven't tried them in many other applications.  
  
## Oil, Water and Baking Powder  
  
I've used this once when I had nothing else and it worked fine. I'm sort of suspicious at how well it worked.   
  
Tried in cupcakes.  
  
If you need some kind of rising action from your eggs this should work well.  
  
**1 Egg:**    
1.5 tablespoons of water    
1.5 tablespoons of oil (vegtable or other)    
1 teaspoon of baking powder    
  
## Banana  
  
Pros: sweet, will add banana taste  
Cons: no rising action, will add a banana taste  
  
Also a simple one. Banana adds only moisture, so if you need some rising (leavening) this won't do it. Maybe add a little baking powder to avoid it getting too dense.  
  
Tried in brownies.  
  
**1 Egg:**    
Half a ripe banana, mashed    
## Aquafaba  
  
The water from a can of chickpeas. Honestly, great stuff. Very light. Similar to the oil and water option above, but also whips up well as an egg white replacement.  
  
Tried in biscuits, cupcakes. I think it works in vegan mayo too.  
  
**1 Egg:**    
3 tablespoons of Aquafaba, or 2 if only eggs whites    
  
## Applesauce  
  
Similar to banana, this is dense and has no leavening action.   
  
Tried in muffins. Didn't affect the taste.  
  
**1 Egg:**    
1/4 cup of applesauce or a couple big tablespoons.
