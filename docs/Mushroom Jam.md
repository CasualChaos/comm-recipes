## Description  
I don't actually remember what the real name for this recipe is.   
This was originally a side/entree for dinner, but I think it's great for breakfast. Put this on toast and have a great day. I just used whatever button mushrooms are available.  
  
Replace the beef stock with veggie stock/broth and replace butter with an equal amount of olive oil for vegetarian/vegan versions. If not using beef stock, I'd reduce the worcestershire sauce by half so it's a bit less overwhelming.  
## Ingredients  
   
- 250g sliced mushrooms  
- 3 tbsp butter (or olive oil)  
- 1 tbsp olive oil  
- 1-2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 sprig of fresh thyme (1 tsp dried)  
- Salt and pepper  
- 2 tbsp flour  
- 1 1/2 cup beef stock (or veggie stock)  
- 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce  
  
  
## Instructions   
1. Add 2 tablespoons butter and your olive oil to a medium frying pan on medium heat.  
2. Add your sliced mushrooms to the melted butter and stir. Cooking until the mushrooms shrink down and absorb the liquid (at least 5min).  
3. Add the remaining butter, garlic, thyme and salt and pepper. Continue to stir for another 10min or so. Sprinkle in the flour and mix until it's no longer visibly clumpy. Add the stock and worcestershire sauce and cook for another 5 minutes or until it's thickened into a gravy.  
4. Serve.
