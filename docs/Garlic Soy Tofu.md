## Description  
Simple entree or side dish. Serve with rice. Plain or [Fried](./Fried%20Rice.html).  
## Ingredients  
  
#### Main  
- 350g Tofu  
- Spring Onion, garnish  
- 3/4 cup Cornflour  
- Sesame seeds  
- Oil  
#### Sauce  
- 2 garlic cloves, minced  
- 1 tbsp regular soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce  
- 1 tsp Chinese cooking wine, optional  
- 1 tsp white sugar  
- 1 tsp rice vinegar/white vinegar

- 1/2 cup water room temperature  
  
## Instructions  
1. In a small bowl, combine the sauce ingredients and set aside.

3. Spread cornflour onto a large plate or baking sheet and gently coat the diced tofu in small batches. Add more cornflour as needed.   
4. Heat oil in a large pan on medium heat. Fry coated tofu until golden and crispy, about 14-20 mins in total, flipping over halfway.   
5. Add the sauce into the pan and simmer to thicken.  
6. Toss fried tofu in the thickened sauce until evenly coated. Remove from heat. Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds.
