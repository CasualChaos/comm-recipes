## Description  
## Ingredients  
   
- 1 egg  
- 3/4 cup milk  
- 1 cup flour  
- 3 tbsp castor sugar  
- Butter, for frying   
  
## Instructions   
1. Whisk eggs, milk and vanilla together in a jug. Sift flour into a large bowl. Stir in sugar. Make a well in the centre. Add milk mixture. Whisk until combined.   
2. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Grease pan with butter.  Using ~1/4 cup mixture per pancake, cook pancakes until bubbles appear and pop on surface (~2min). Turn and cook for a further 1-2 minutes or until cooked through. Transfer to a plate.
