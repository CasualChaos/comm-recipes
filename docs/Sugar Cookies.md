Made this with coconut sugar once and it was so good. I want to try with a dark muscovado sugar or some other caramelly sugar. Reduce butter a little to keep wet/dry ratio the same.

## Description  
Simple sugar cookies. Good for icing and making fun shapes.  
## Ingredients  
   
- 100g unsalted butter, softened at room temperature  
- 100g caster sugar  
- 1 medium free-range egg, lightly beaten  
- 275g plain flour  
- 1 tsp vanilla extract  
  
### Icing  
- 400g icing sugar  
- 3-4 tbsp water  
- 2-3 drops food colouring  
  
    
  
## Instructions   
1. Preheat the oven to 170C Fan. Line a baking tray with grease proof paper.  
2. Cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl until combined.  
3. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.  
4. Stir in the flour until the mixture comes together as a dough.  
5. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured work surface to a thickness of 1cm.  
6. Cut biscuits out of the dough and carefully place onto the baking tray.  
7. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until pale golden-brown. Leave to harden for 5 minutes, then cool on a wire rack.  
8. For the icing, add the icing sugar into a large mixing bowl and stir in enough water to create a smooth mixture. Add water slowly to avoid making it too watery. Stir in food colouring.   
9. Carefully spread the icing onto the biscuits and leave to harden.
