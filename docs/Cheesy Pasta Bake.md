## Description    
Honestly this recipe is a lie. I almost never make this.   
  
Make up a batch of [Simple Pasta Sauce](Simple Pasta Sauce.html), cook whatever else you want (canned lentils, bacon, mushrooms, canned tuna) and add to sauce. Cook your pasta until it's about 4min from done. Chuck all of that in a baking dish/casserole dish, put cheese on top and whack it in the oven at about 200C for 20-30min. EZ. Make sure your pasta sauce isn't too dry also.   
  
The bocconcini is critical, so good. Plus you can use leftovers on your [pizza](Pizza Dough.html).  
  
## Ingredients    
     
-  500g pasta, penne or spiral is nice    
- 2 tbsp olive oil    
- 2 brown onions, diced    
- 2 garlic cloves, minced    
- 150g smoked pancetta (or bacon)(or mushrooms), finely diced    
- 2 tins canned tomatoes    
- 1 bunch basil    
- 150g Mozzarella, grated    
- 150g baby bocconcini balls    
- 50g parmesan, grated    
- Salt and pepper    
    
## Instructions     
    
1. Pre-heat oven to 200C.    
    
2. To make the pasta sauce, heat olive oil in a pan. Add onions, garlic and pancetta/bacon and cook for 5-7 minutes on a medium heat until onion is golden brown and caramelised.    
    
3. Add tomatoes and basil and season with salt and pepper. Adjust temperature to low to medium, stir occasionally for around 20 minutes until the sauce has thickened and the tomatoes have cooked down.    
    
4. In a pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta halfway (or -4min from suggested time whichever is longer) and drain pasta.    
    
5. Put everything in a baking dish. Coat pasta with sauce and cover with cheeses.     
    
6. Cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes.
