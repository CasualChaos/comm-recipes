## Description  
Lemony, sugary goodness.  
Add some shredded coconut to the mix if you want to change things up.  
## Ingredients  
   
- 1 cup granulated sugar (200g)  
- 1 tablespoon grated lemon zest  
- ½ teaspoon salt  
- ½ cup unsalted butter melted (113g)  
- 2 large eggs  
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice (60ml)  
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
- 2⅓ cups self raising flour (280g)  
- ¾ cup icing sugar (98g)  
  
## Instructions  
  
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, lemon zest, and salt. For extra flavor, rub the sugar and zest together with your fingers until the mixture feels like wet sand. Whisk in the melted butter, eggs, lemon juice, and vanilla until well combined.  
2. Fold the flour into the sugar mixture until well combined. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.  
3. Preheat the oven to 175°C. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper.  
4. Add the icing sugar to a small bowl and set it aside.  
5. Scoop the chilled cookie dough into balls using a 1 ½ tablespoon spring-loaded scoop or a heaping tablespoon if you don’t have a scoop. If it's a warm day, do in batches keeping excess dough in the fridge to keep cool.   
6. Roll the scooped dough between your palms to form smooth balls. Coat each dough ball with icing sugar, and place 2-3cm apart on a lined baking sheet.  
7. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes or until the tops crack and the bottom edges are just starting to brown. Let cool on the pan for 2 minutes then transfer the cookies to a wire rack and allow to cool completely. Cookies can be stored in an airtight container for up to 5 days.
