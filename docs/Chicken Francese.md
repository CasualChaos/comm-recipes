## Description  
Lemon, garlic, chicken. This is quick and easy for dinner.  
Good with asparagus or beans on the side. Serve with something that will soak up the sauce, mashed potatoes, rice, even bread.  
Wine is optional, you can just leave it out or add extra lemon juice. An affordable chardonnay is a good option.  
  
## Ingredients  
   
- 500g Chicken Breasts  
- 1/4 cup Plain Flour  
- Pinch of Salt  
- 1/2 tsp Black Pepper  
- 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder  
- 1 large Egg  
- 1/4 cup Parmesan (finely grated), optional  
- 1 1/2 tbsp Olive Oil  
- 1 tbsp Butter  
### Sauce  
- 1 Lemon, slice 4 rings and keep ends for juice  
- 1/4 cup dry white wine, optional or sub tbsp lemon juice  
- 3/4 cup chicken stock  
- 4-5 1cm cubes of butter (60g-ish)  
- 1 tbsp fresh chives or parmesan diced.  
  
## Instructions   
  
1. Get two shallow bowls. Mix flour, garlic powder, salt and pepper in one and beat the egg into the other mixing in the parmesan if using.  
2. Slice the two chicken breasts horizontally through the centre to create 4 even-sized breasts. Coat each of them in the flour then return to the chopping board.  
3. Add oil and butter to a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Put egg bowl next to the pan, then one by one coat the chicken in the egg, allow excess to drip off and place in the pan. If your pan is small, don't crowd it.  
4. Cook each side for around 3 minutes, or until golden on the outside and just about cooked right through the centre. Remove the chicken from the pan and place on a plate to one side.  
5. Add the lemon slices to the pan and fry for around 30 seconds each side, until they start to soften and lightly brown. Remove onto a plate.  
6. Pour in the wine and rapid simmer for around 2 minutes, or until it has mostly evaporated, deglazing the pan as needed. Pour in the stock, squeeze about 1 tbsp lemon juice and bring to a simmer.  
7. Add the cubed butter to the leftover flour then toss coat. Add the floured butter to the pan and swiftly mix until it blends into the stock. Add the chives/parsley and continue simmering and stirring until the sauce turns cloudy and thickens slightly to a glossy texture. Add more lemon juice or seasoning as you want.  
8. Add the chicken alongside any resting juices and place then lemon slices on top. Baste in the sauce to warm it back through then serve and enjoy.
