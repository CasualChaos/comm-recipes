## Description  
I eat this for breakfast. I probably shouldn't.  
I like to roll the dough on the long edge to have smaller cinnamon rolls, but you can roll on the short edge for fatter rolls.  
Spreading on the frosting when the rolls are still warm helps the frosting spread more smoothly without melting everywhere.  
## Ingredients  
   
**DOUGH**  
- ¾ cup (180 grams) milk  
- 2 ¼ teaspoons dry yeast  
- ¼ cup (50 grams) granulated sugar  
- 57 grams salted butter, melted   
- 1 egg   
- 1 egg yolk  
- 3 cups (360 grams) plain flour  
- ¾ teaspoon salt  
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, optional  
  
 **FILLING**  
- 4 tablespoons (57 grams) salted butter, softened  
- ⅔ cup (142 grams) packed dark brown sugar  
- 1 ½ tablespoons ground cinnamon  
  
**CREAM CHEESE FROSTING**  
- 112 grams cream cheese, softened (half a pack)  
- ¾ cup (85 grams) icing sugar  
- 3 (42g) tablespoons salted butter, softened  
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract  
  
## Instructions   
1. Warm the milk by microwaving it for 45 seconds. You want it to be warm (30C-40C) I find 45 to 50 seconds in a 1000W microwave is good.  
2. Add yeast and sugar, mix and let sit for 5min to let the yeast foam.  
3. Add the rest of your wets (butter, egg + egg yolk) and mix.  
4. Carefully stir in the flour and salt (and nutmeg) until a dough begins to form.  
5. Knead your dough for 5-10min. Add a little more flour if it's too sticky. Once your bounces back if you gently poke it's ready.  
6. Return to the bowl and cover with a tea towel or cling film. Leave somewhere warm to rise for about an hour to an hour and a half. It should double in size. Don't worry too much about over-proofing in this step, you'll roll it again later.  
7. Dust a the bench with flour. Roll out the dough into a rectangle. Aim for like 5mm thick, thicker is okay. You want it to hold together enough to roll up and it's easier if the long is parallel to you. I like it about twice as long as it is wide.   
8. Spread the softened butter over the dough. In a bowl, mix together the brown sugar and cinnamon. Spread the mixture evenly over the butter.   
9. Starting on the long side, carefully roll the dough up as tightly as you can. Pinch the seam to close or use a little butter/oil to help seal.  
10. Oil a baking dish or cake tin that is at least 22x22cm.  
11. With the seam on the bottom of the roll, use a sharp knife to cut into 3-4cm slices. The knife will squish your rolls a bit, just gently nudge the back into shape.  
12. Place your rolls in the dish, leave a little space between each roll (about 1-2cm). Cover and leave somewhere warm to rise for 45min to an hour. Your rolls should puff up, almost double and end up lightly touching.   
13. Preheat the oven to 175C.  
14. Once the rolls have risen, remove the covering and bake until golden brown on the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool for 5-10 minutes.  
15. *While the rolls are cooling make your frosting.* Chop your cream cheese into chunks and soften in the microwave. In a bowl add the cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla. With some kind of whisk (electronic is easiest), beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to medium-high speed until smooth and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Spread the frosting over the warm rolls and serve.
